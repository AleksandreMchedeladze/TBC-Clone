# TBC-Clone using HTML, CSS, And JS only.

## I made clone of https://www.tbcacademy.ge/usaid, in few days. I tried to make it as similar as possible.

Biggest difference between the sites would be the slider, On my version there is no buttons and you can click on the whole slider to change to next logos, It also does it automatically like the original website. Everything else is more or less the same(Colors, Buttons, Links, Structure...). 
Biggest flaw i have is i couldn't make it Responsive. So it's terrible when the screen is smaller. If i did it again my main goal would be to make it responsive probably would have used grid or flexbox more.

##How to see the project.

1. Download the zip file and unzip.
2. Open the code on any browser.
